As with a lot of things, cost per unit typically reduces when making multiples of the same thing. This is due to a number of factors including design, programming, sourcing materials and setting up. Not only can we not get the same economy of scale with one-off items, we also need to take design time into account.<\/p>"

To keep costs down, some of our products are available unsealed as raw, sanded timber. In some applications, no further finishing is required, particularly if you are comfortable with cleaning any marks with some fine sandpaper (180 grit). Alternatively, if you prefer to clean your surfaces with a damp cloth, then a seal is recommended to protect the timber from spills and any wet cleaning processes that may cause dust to be embedded into the timber.<\/p><p>Sealing also offers an extra layer of protection for the plywood and will extend the life of your product.<\/p>"
