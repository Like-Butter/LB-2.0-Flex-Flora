Like Butter has gained a reputation for its approach to design and fabrication that is based on flexible and lateral thinking, strong aesthetics and considered detailing, in order to achieve the simplest and most effective solutions for the project at hand. We achieve this through process, pushing our materials and our machines to their limits. Like Butter has functioned across multiple industries; from its own furniture and lighting products, to one-off commissions for significant design and fabrication projects, to public art installations, through to film and animation production. The common thread? Learning through play, and ‘just making stuff’.<\/p>",

Where a legacy product falls short, we’re phasing it out or redesigning it better. Where investment is needed, we’re backing our vision. Production is now largely solar powered, with our new factory in Castlemaine equipped with 33kWh of roof-top generation. This mission is also why in 2020, we pledged to donate 1% of our gross profit to a tree planting or tree protection not-for-profit, as part of Sawdust Bureau's Treemaker initiative.<\/p>",
